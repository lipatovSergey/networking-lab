# Networking Lab

This repository contains a set of **small practical experiments** focused on networking fundamentals.

The goal is to better understand how common web technologies work at a lower level — such as TCP, HTTP, TLS, DNS, and WebSockets — by experimenting with them directly.

Each folder is an independent lab with minimal code, simple notes, and observations.
